When to go for React and when to go for Angular?

- Library can build application.
  Framework can build and control application flow.

- Actually, server-side technology also handles / uses a framework that is having rich features. In that case we don't need a framework on client side. We only need a UI in frontend so, library in frontend is better.
  But sometimes, it requires to minimize the overhead on server and full control is required in frontend that's why in that case, framework on frontend is good.

What is React?

- React is a JavaScript library which is used to build UI
- UI = SPA
- Fluid UX
- Unified UX
- Loosely Coupled and Extensible

React uses some framework:

Ionic, NativeScript

What are the features of React?

1. Component Based
   - Easy to build interface
   - Easy to reuse
   - Making building faster
   - Easy to extend
   - Loosely coupled

2. Modular Library

Legacy Library (50 features) => 5 features [importing all] => Bootstrap
Modular Library (50 features) => 5 features [implort only the required] => Tailwind CSS

   - Application specific library
   - Improves the performance of the application
   - Light-weight application.

3. Asynchronous Library
   - Implicitly uses Ajax

4. Uses Virtual DOM

5. Faster

6. Better Performance

Virtual DOM
-----------

1. What is DOM?

2. What is Shadow DOM?

Root and Shadow hierarchy

<input type="file">

3. Virtual DOM

   - ReactDOM

Cons of React:

- React is a library [can build application but can't control flow]
- Needs support of various frameworks explicitly.
- React supports various 3rd party libraries.
	Form and Validation: Formik, Yup
	API: Axios etc.
- Pace of developement is very fast.
	First version: 2013 - 2022 (18)
- Poor documentation
